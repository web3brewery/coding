        <p class="section-Tag"> Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many
            debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
            whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some
            researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
            disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to
            the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying
            education. There are many types of education.

        <p class="section-Tag">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional
            framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal
            schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and
            non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education,
            secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
            teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject,
            like science education, language education,

        <p class="section-Tag">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It
            equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic
            growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of
            education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what
            is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like been influential in
            promoting primary education for all children. Many factors influence whether education is successful.
            Psychological factors include motivation intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic
            status, ethnicity, and
            gender, are often linked to discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality,
            and parent involvement.
